The script suggests to play a game based on 2 options: you can choose a play game where you type a name of a city and the computer replies with a name 
which starts with the last letter of the previous word. Then you should choose a town which starts with the last letter of a previous word, respectively. 
The second option is an example of a leaflet map in R environment.
